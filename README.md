<h2>Scenario</h2>
Imagine you are an Alten Frontend consultant and you got assigned to a project at one of our top partners.
They have a number of connected vehicles that belongs to a number of customers.
They have a need to be able to view the status of the connection among these vehicles on a monitoring display.
The vehicles send the status of the connection one time per minute.
The status can be compared with a ping (network trace); no request from the vehicle means no connection.
